# AemiJS

AemiJS is a bunch of scripts and micro-lib that can help programming with vanilla JS. You can notice that there is no external import.

Code is yet poorly commented but I'll improve that and I really welcome any help, advice and questions.

Happy coding!

## Usage

See branches:

- [esm-browser](https://github.com/aemi-dev/aemijs/tree/esm-browser)
- [nodejs](https://github.com/aemi-dev/aemijs/tree/nodejs)

Soon.
